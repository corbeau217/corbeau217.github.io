### `.md` / un-themed posts
* not cucrrently (20250522) converted in to cards for the site
* used for exploring ideas separate from a theme, without cluttering up documentation of other projects
* these may or may not be acted apon in the future, and are mostly intended to get the brain worm somewhere to exist without burying it out of sight
* usually reserved for open source projects and ideas which arent directly dependent on another project
