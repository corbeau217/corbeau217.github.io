    * currently just the JSON files used for each text

    * currently just a rotating can tech demo ported over from an older iteration of the website, to break the surface of decision paralysis
* `Daily` - daily posts idea we had. fun idea to spend some time on
    * who knows when it'll end
* `aoc_2024` - advent of code attempts, not many though

* ***That's too far away*** 
* ***I'm out of range***

## page building
### blurb
* putting stuff here so it is typed up, but will likely be forgotten for a while

### ideas
* suggesting the idea that we revisit page building
* custom colours
* custom fonts
* themed things
* change to having pages announce where they are so the nav menu can use it
* announce their resources etc
